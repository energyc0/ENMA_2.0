# ENMA programming language 2.0
This language is written in C and is improved over the previous version (previous version was written in C++ and had a lot of troubles).

## About
This is just a common programming language which supports variables, conditionals, loops and function (I want to add classes). I created it for my practice, because I love programming <3.

## Program structure
Program consists of declaration which can be either a function declaration or a function definition or a variable definition. All this transforms into statements and expression. More info you can find in **grammar.md**. 

## Program execution
Firstly, it translates user-written code into bytecode for virtual machine. Then my virtual machine executes the code. More info about bytecode you can find in **bytecode.md**.
